Javascript is a synchronous and single threaded.
Execution context - execute code line by line.
                - Each operation wait for last one to complete before executing.

Blocking code - block the flow of program. ex - read file synchronusly
Non Blocking code - Does not block Execution ex- read file asynchronusly

Async example - setTimeout,setInterval, etc.
